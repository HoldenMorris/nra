NRA
===


'Node-Rest-Auth' authenticates rest type http api requests using a username, nonce salt and a hash.

Warning
-------

This library is still under development. There are bugs. APIs will change. Docs may be wrong.

Keep in mind this is something I make in my free time and that's something I've had very little of lately thanks to my many other projects.

Installation
------------

    npm install nra

Example
-------

~~~ javascript
var nra = require('nra');

nra("message");
~~~

This will return true or false.
